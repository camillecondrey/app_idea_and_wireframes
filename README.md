Help users discover what type of dog breed their personality is most compatible with by taking a short quiz. Upon 
providing the user with the breed they matched with, they can search for that breed by location using the PetFinder API which
will direct them to the closest shelter to them that has that breed for adoption. 

User sees landing page with mission statement, step by step (3) breakdown of what the app does, and option to proceed with
quiz or go ahead and search for adoptable dogs. 

If user chooses to take quiz, they are directed to new page with Quiz. After they complete the quiz, they are given their 
results. 

Or they can scroll down to search. Results section appears after submit is hit. If user does not enter a location, they are 
asked to do so before they can view results.
